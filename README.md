1. Push up the code!

    ```sh
    git push casa main
    ```

1. Run some workflows! Go to `https://casa.dev/_$MY_TEAM_NAME_/_$MY_CODEBASE_NAME_/main/workflows` and click "Sync" to create and run your workflows.

1. Write some docs, write some code, run some workflows to deploy stuff, train models, do inference, and more! ðŸ”¥
